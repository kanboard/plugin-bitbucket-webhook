1. On Kanboard, go to the project settings and choose the section **Integrations**
2. Copy the Bitbucket webhook URL
3. On Bitbucket, go to the project settings and go to the section **Webhooks**
4. Choose a title for your webhook and paste the Kanboard URL

### Examples

You have to create some automatic actions in your project to make it work:

#### Close a Kanboard task when a commit pushed to Bitbucket

- Choose the event: **Bitbucket commit received**
- Choose action: **Close the task**

When one or more commits are sent to Bitbucket, Kanboard will receive the information, each commit message with a task number included will be closed.

Example:

- Commit message: "Fix bug #1234"
- That will close the Kanboard task #1234

#### Add comment when a commit received

- Choose the event: **Bitbucket commit received**
- Choose action: **Create a comment from an external provider**

The comment will contain the commit message and the URL to the commit.
